                HIDING (feat. altr) In case you ever thought of hiding in your
                solace, because the room was cold, the ambience was empty, the
                music stopped playing and the heart felt lonely. This song is
                for you. Dedicated to all the beautiful souls that hide their
                vibrant twin behind a facade, a face that is filled with
                trouble. <br />
                The verse is meant to remind you that every moment of stray
                comes to a chorus, a resolution.<br />

                Listen to altr and Madison as they sing in harmony, listen to
                their gentle sound. In all beauty, music comes from a deeper
                place, a place where lots of us find a safe HIDING space.
